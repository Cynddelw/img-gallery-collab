Applied some css grid to the gallery items and added in some manga placeholders. 
They are all the same size. Added some starter code for the media queries & navbar. 
I think you could design the navbar similar to the one on your website. 
Pretty rusty on the web design. 
I'll start doing the path again on CA, because I felt a little blind here.
